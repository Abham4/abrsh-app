                    For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish,
                     but may have life everlasting. ... For God so loved the world that he gave his on
                    e and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal lifeAncient Jews usually had
                     only one name, and, when greater specificity was needed, it was customary to add the father’s name or the place
                      of origin. Thus, in his lifetime Jesus was called Jesus son of Joseph (Luke 4:22; John 1:45, 6:42), Jesus of 
                      Nazareth (Acts 10:38), or Jesus the Nazarene (Mark 1:24; Luke 24:19). After his death he came to be called 
                      Jesus Christ. Christ was not originally a name but a title derived from the Greek word christos, which translates
                       the Hebrew term meshiah (Messiah), meaning “the anointed one.” This title indicates that Jesus’ followers 
                       believed him to be the anointed son of King David, whom some Jews expected to restore the fortunes of Israel. 
                       Passages such as Acts of the Apostles 2:36 show that some early Christian writers knew that the Christ was 
                       properly a title, but in many passages of the New Testament, including those in the letters of the Apostle Paul, 
                       he name and title are combined and used together as Jesus’ name: Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus (Romans 1:1; 3:24).
                        Paul sometimes simply used Christ as Jesus’ name (e.g., Romans 5:6)
